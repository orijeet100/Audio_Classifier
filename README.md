# Audio Classifier

A machine learning project designed to classify audio samples using techniques implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. This repository is intended for experimenting with and demonstrating audio classification workflows, likely involving feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- **Audio Preprocessing**: Prepare and clean audio data for modeling.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from audio files, such as MFCCs, chroma, and spectrograms.
- **Model Training**: Build and train machine learning or deep learning models for audio classification.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of trained models using standard metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

You may need to install additional dependencies such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `librosa`, or `tensorflow/pytorch` depending on the specific implementation inside the notebooks.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orijeet100/Audio_Classifier.git
cd Audio_Classifier
